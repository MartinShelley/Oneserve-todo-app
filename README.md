# OneserveTodoApp

This challenge was to create a to-do list application using Angular that allows a user to manage tasks with data persistence between sessions.

The application must include the following functionality:
* A Task should consist of a title
* Users should be able to access the app via a browser
* Tasks should display as a list
* Task state should persist between page reloads (we do not need to manage state for multiple different users, no auth is required)
* Users can create new tasks
* Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete

## Running the application

To get a copy of the application, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where you which to store the application and run `git clone https://github.com/MartinShelley/Oneserve-todo-app.git`.

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory using `cd Oneserve-todo-app` and run `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies. 
Once that is complete, run `npm start` in your terminal to start the dev server, then in your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the application.
